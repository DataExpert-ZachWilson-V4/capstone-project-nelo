# 3-In-1 MLB Game Stats Pipeline/Predictor/Chat-Bot




## Objective
To fetch historical & current MLB game stats from the MLB API. Process and store the data in IceBerg tables. Train multiple ML models to predict future game stats of the current season, and store these predictions back into Iceberg tables. All tables are converted to text embeddings using OpenAI's embeddings and stored in a Qdrant vector store. A RAG model is set up to retrieve the embeddings in Qdrant that match closest to the query embeddings generated by SentenceTransformers and combines into text prompts. These prompts are fed into OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo, which generates responses to user queries. The responses from OpenAI GPT is then displayed in the Streamlit app. The response can also be converted to an audio file using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) and played back within the Streamlit app.
